# Module 3 PyPoll Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of this project is to write additional code to a file to return accurate results for a) voter turnout for each county; b) the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count; c) the county with the highest turnout.  The additional requirements should display in the terminal and be written to election_results.txt in the same format as the original code.  The file used to obtain the data is in the Resource Folder and located here: [](Resources/election_results.csv).  The file created by the audit is located in the Analysis folder and is located here: [](Analysis/election_results.txt).
